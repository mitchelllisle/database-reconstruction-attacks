This notebook is adapted from a paper on database reconstruction attacks. You can find the paper [here.](

There are a number of reasons businesses and governments want to share information about people.
It is important that when sharing information, you consider privacy and anonymity of the people that data is
derived from. In most cases, aggregate data does little to hinder hackers from being able to re-create a database
that is either very close, or exactly the same as the original data. In this application,
we will take a simple example and re-create the database from nothing but aggregate statistics about those people.

We will mainly use [Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3) for this.


Imagine we have the following database that contains information for people within a certain geographic area
(going forward we refer to this area as a **block**.

We have *7* people in total in this block. Alongside <span style="color:#016FB9">**age**</span>, we also have each resident's
<span style="color:#FF9505">**smoking status**</span>, <span style="color:#DA3E52">**employment status**</span> and
whether they are <span style="color:#6CC551">**married**</span> or not, we publish a variety of
statistics. You have probably seen something similar in your countries census.

> üìì To simplify the example, this fictional world has:
 - Two <span style="color:#6CC551">**marriage**</span> statuses; Married (**True**) or Single (**False**)
 - Two <span style="color:#FF9505">**smoking**</span> statuses; Non-Smoker (**False**) or Smoker (**True**)
 - Two <span style="color:#DA3E52">**employment statuses**</span>;  Unemployed (**False**) or Employed (**True**)

> üëæ One additional piece of logic we know is that any statistics with a count of less than 3 is suppressed


## Install
You can run this application through a cli command. To install, you can run the following for inside the parent dir

```shell
pip install .
```

## Usage
To run, you can use thte `dra` command after pip installing. The positional args are required:

input file: the file to pass in with the block stats
solution: the solution file which is what the original database. the input file stats are derived from this file
output file: the file to create for the re-constructed database to compare with the solution file

optional args:

--min-age: the minimum age constraint, default: 0
--max-age: the maximum age constraint, default: 115

```shell
dra data/block-stats.csv data/solution.csv data/reconstruction.csv
```

The logs will look something like this (Note the accuracy being reported when compared to the solution)

```shell
INFO:dra.logger:starting DatabaseReconstructionAttack runner...
INFO:dra.logger:running DRA...
INFO:dra.logger:DRA complete. Accuracy achieved 93%
INFO:dra.logger:reconstructed database: data/reconstruction.csv
```

The reconstructed database will look something like this:
```
age,married,smoker,employed
9,False,False,False
20,False,True,True
24,False,False,True
30,True,True,True
36,True,False,False
66,True,False,False
84,True,True,False
```

The original database:
```
age,married,smoker,employed
8,False,False,False
18,False,True,True
24,False,False,True
30,True,True,True
36,True,False,False
66,True,False,False
84,True,True,False
```
